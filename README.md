# Hello, I'm Mustapha Hankar! 👋

I am a **Data Scientist** and a **Researcher** specializing in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My experience spans academic research, applied machine learning, and data science , with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

## 🧠 About Me

- 💼 Data Scientist and Researcher
- 📜 **PhD** in Computer Science (NLP)
- 📊 Skilled in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Data Visualization**, Time Series Analaysis, and **NLP**
- 💻 Experienced in building **end-to-end machine learning systems** and deploying data-driven solutions for real-world problems
- 📝 Published research papers in **NLP**, **AI**, and **machine learning** in international journals and conferences

## 🚀 Main Projects

- **[COVID-19 Spread Prediction](link-to-your-project)**: Built a deep learning model(LSTM) to predict and track the spread of COVID-19 in Morocco. Presented actionnable recommenadations to policymakers to improve their decission making process. 
- **[COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis](link-to-your-project)**: Collected a large [dataset](link) containing more than 30,000 comments about COVID-19 and applied sentiment analysis techniques and machine learning to track the impacts of the pandemic over a 3-year period. Experimental results demonstrated how drastically the outbreak affected all aspects of daily life. 
- **[British Airways Sentiment Analysis](link-to-your-project)**: Built an end-to-end system for aspect-based sentiment analysis, analyzing customer reviews for service insights.
- **[Used Car Price Estimation](link-to-your-project)**: Developed a web-based application using machine learning to predict used car prices with 88% accuracy. Deployed the application in the cloud for end users using Streamlit framework. 
- **[COVID-19 Detection with CNN](link-to-your-project)**: Built a CNN model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. I trained and evaluated the moel on a dataset containing of X-ray images from both infected and healthy individuals. The classifier achieved an outstanding accuracy of 96% in detecting COVID-19 infection. 
- **[Offline ETL Pipeline](link-to-your-project)**: Devlopped an offline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, and performs necessary transformations on extracted data, and finally loads the transformed data into a MySQL database.
