# Hello, I'm Mustapha Hankar! üëã

I am a **Data Scientist** and a **Researcher** specializing in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My experience spans academic research, applied machine learning, and data science , with a particular focus on natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

## üöÄ Main Projects

- **[COVID-19 Sentiment Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10255411)**: Collected a large [dataset](https://github.com/HankarM88/Hespress_COVID-19_Dataset) containing more than 30,000 comments about COVID-19 and applied sentiment analysis techniques and machine learning to track the impacts of the pandemic over a 3-year period. Experimental results demonstrated how drastically the outbreak affected all aspects of daily life. 
- **[British Airways Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/HankarM88/British_Airways_Reviews_Sentiment_Analaysis)**: Built an end-to-end Machine Learning system for aspect-based sentiment analysis of British Airways reviews. The system provides useful insights for the company to track passenger‚Äôs feedback and help them improve some of their services. 
- **[Used Car Price Estimation](https://github.com/HankarM88/Used-Car-Price-Prediction)**: Developed a web-based application using machine learning to predict used car prices with 88% accuracy. Deployed the application in the cloud for end users using Streamlit framework. 
- **[COVID-19 Detection with CNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hankarmostafa/covid19-detection-from-lungs-x-ray-images)**: Built a CNN model to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. I trained and evaluated the model on a dataset containing X-ray images from both infected and healthy individuals. The classifier achieved an outstanding accuracy of 96% in detecting COVID-19 infection. 
- **[Offline ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/HankarM88/ETL-Pipeline)**: Devlopped an offline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, and performs necessary transformations on extracted data, and finally loads the transformed data into a MySQL database.
